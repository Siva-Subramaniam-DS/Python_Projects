## Mobile Shop Management System
This Python program simulates a mobile shop management system using a class-based approach. The program allows users to add mobile details, display various lists (brands, models, colors, prices), and perform searches based on user preferences.

Class: Phone
The Phone class represents mobile phones in the shop. It includes class variables for shop details, product details, and sets to store unique brands, colors, and prices. The class has an __init__ method for initializing phone attributes, and various class and object methods for data manipulation and retrieval.

Class Methods:
shop_details(): Displays the shop name, location, and product details.
all_Mobiles_details(): Displays details of all mobiles in the shop.
Brand_Lists(): Displays a list of all unique mobile brands.
sorted_brand(): Displays mobile details grouped by brand.
Model_Lists(): Displays a list of all mobile models.
color_Lists(): Displays a list of all mobile colors.
sorted_color(): Displays mobile details grouped by color.
price_Lists(): Displays a list of all mobile prices.
sorted_price(): Displays mobile details grouped by price.
choice_brand(): Searches and displays mobiles based on user-chosen brand.
choice_color(): Searches and displays mobiles based on user-chosen color.
choice_price(): Searches and displays mobiles based on user-chosen price.

Object Methods:
Mobiles_details(): Displays details of a specific mobile.

How to Run the Program
Save the code in a file, e.g., mobile_shop.py.
Run the program using a Python interpreter: python mobile_shop.py.
Follow the prompts in the console to interact with the mobile shop management system.
Explore the functionalities of the mobile shop management system to add, display, and search for mobile details based on various criteria.

## Python Games

Rock, Paper, Scissors Game This Python program implements a simple Rock, Paper, Scissors game where the user plays against the computer. The game keeps track of the user's points and allows them to check their total points at any time.

Class: rps The rps class represents the Rock, Paper, Scissors game. It includes a class variable count to keep track of the user's points. The class has a class method game that simulates a single round of the game.

Class Method: game(user): Simulates a single round of the game. Takes the user's choice as an argument, generates a random choice for the computer, compares the choices, and updates the points accordingly.

How to Run the Program Save the code in a file, e.g., rock_paper_scissors.py. Run the program using a Python interpreter: python rock_paper_scissors.py. Follow the prompts in the console to play the Rock, Paper, Scissors game. Enjoy playing the game and see how many points you can score against the computer! Thank you for playing (^_^)!
